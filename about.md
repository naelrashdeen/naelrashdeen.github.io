I'm a technologist with 4+ years of professional experience under my belt. I'm 24, live in Copenhagen and work at <a href="https://monstar-lab.com/global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monstar Lab, Inc</a>. 

I built this website for fun, to start documenting my personal challenges and learnings within the field of software engineering and technical leadership.

I enjoy working with people and enabling potentials through technology. The mix of actively coding and engineering management is a part of my day to day work, which i'm enjoying so far. âœ¨



<!-- I have always enjoyed the aspect of building stuff since I was a kid whether it being Lego or Minecraft. Therefore when I had to make the decision to pursue a degree after highschool [ComputerScience] seemed appealing. -->
