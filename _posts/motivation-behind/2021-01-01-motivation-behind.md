# Motivation behind

Being in the tech environment I work in, I proactively keep myself up to date on the latest trends and technologies. In order to do so, I try to read a lot and actively code on all the projects I work on. ðŸ‘€

For me it's my curiosity to constantly learn and challenge myself which ***really*** is the main motivation behind what I do. I therefore built this website to document my learnings and experiences, whether it being moments from meetings or something tech/code related. ðŸ¤“

I hope to learn and reflect from whatever comes out of this!
