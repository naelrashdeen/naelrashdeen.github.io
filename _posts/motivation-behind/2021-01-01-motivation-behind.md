# Motivation behind

Being in the tech environment I work in, I constantly feel that i'm working with people better or brighter than me. As if that wasn't enough, staying up to date and open minded to different technologies and know how's is an essential trait to have as well. ðŸ‘€

For me it's my curiosity to learn and build stuff which ***really*** is the main motivation behind what I do. I therefore built this website to document my learnings and experiences, whether it being moments from meetings or something tech/code related. ðŸ¤“

I hope to learn and reflect from whatever comes out of this!
